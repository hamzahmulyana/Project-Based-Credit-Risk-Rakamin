## About

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assess credit risk for a multifinance company, enhancing the accuracy of borrower eligibility evaluations and reducing the potential for loan defaults. The dataset includes historical loan records along with various relevant attributes such as customer profiles, payment histories, and loan characteristics.

The analysis process is as follows:

1. **Business Understanding**: Comprehension of business goals and needs to ensure that the implemented solutions are relevant and valuable.
2. **Data Understanding**: The process of collecting, exploring, and analyzing data to understand its quality, structure, and patterns before conducting further analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Methods for analyzing and understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in data through visualization and descriptive statistics before applying models or advanced analytical techniques.
4. **Data Preparation**: The process of cleaning, organizing, and formatting data to ensure its quality and suitability before analysis or modeling.
5. **Modeling Experiment**: The process of creating, testing, and evaluating various analytical models to find the best solution for handling data and achieving business objectives.
6. **Conclution & Recommendation**: The final section of the analysis that summarizes key findings and provides practical recommendations based on the analysis results to support decision-making.
